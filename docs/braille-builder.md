New in MatterControl 1.4, the Braille Builder design tool allows for the
generation of 3D-printable braille labels for the visually impaired. It
is also an excellent way to explore how braille works. As of release,
the Braille Builder supports Grade 1 English Braille, with support for
Grade 2 slated to be added in the near future.
