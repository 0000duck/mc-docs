The Send to Remote Device window allows the user to send models or G-Code files to
another instance of MatterControl signed in to the same
[MatterHackers.com account](matterhackers.com-account.md).

## Select A Device

This list shows all the other instances of MatterControl to which the
signed-in [MatterHackers.com
account](matterhackers.com-account.md) is also signed in. Choose
a destination by clicking the radio button to the left of the printer's
name.

## Slice files prior to send

Check this box to slice a 3D model file using the currently-configured
slice settings before sending it to its destination in the form of a
G-Code file.

## Show unavailable printers

Check this box to show all instances of MatterControl associated with
the currently-signed-in [MatterHackers.com
account](matterhackers.com-account.md) to which the user can
send files. By default the list will only display instances that are
signed in.

## Continue

Click the 'Continue' button to send the file using the selected
settings.

## Cancel

Click the 'Cancel' button to exit the window without sending.
