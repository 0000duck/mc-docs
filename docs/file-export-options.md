the model in one of several formats.

### Export as STL

### Export as AMF

Saves the model(s) currently in 3D View as its own .amf model file.

### Export as G-Code

Slices the model(s) currently in 3D View using the [slice
settings](settings) currently selected and saves the output
as a .gcode file.

### [Export as X3G](export-g-code-as-x3g.md)
