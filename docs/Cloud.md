## File Sharing

MatterControl CLOUD SYNC offers a few different ways to send files.

### Cloud Library

[Cloud Library](library#Cloud_Library) is a feature of
MatterControl that allows for a user with a [MatterHackers.com
account](matterhackers.com-account) to store 3D models and
G-Code files in the Cloud and access them from any instance of
MatterControl that is connected to the Internet and also signed in to
the same account.

### Send

[The Send button in the QUEUE pane](queue#Send) allows the
user to select a destination QUEUE in an instance of MatterControl to
which to transfer a 3D model or G-Code file to. Both instances (origin
and destination) must be signed in to a [MatterHackers.com
account](matterhackers.com-account).

### Sync Dashboard

Upload 3D models and G-Code files directly to a MatterControl QUEUE
using a web-based UI.

## Printer Control

MatterControl CLOUD SYNC allows for remote control of printers.

### Sync Dashboard

Use the CLOUD SYNC Dashboard to control a connected printer. From the
Sync Dashboard, users can:

  - Start printing the first item in a QUEUE in an instance of
    MatterControl
  - Stop an in-progress print
  - View a camera feed from a MatterControl Touch/T10 tablet

#### Add a model or G-Code file to the QUEUE

#### Start a print remotely

## Notifications

Use the [Notifications](options/notifications) section under
the OPTIONS pane to set text message, email, or sound notifications that
alert the user when a print completes.
