The **FILE** menu contains links to commonly-accessed functions
having to do with files and printers.

It can be found at the top left of the MatterControl screen.

Window. If no printers are set up, the [3D Printer Setup
Wizard](3d-printer-setup-wizard.md) is run.

## Add File To Queue

.AMF, .ZIP, or .GCODE file to add to the [QUEUE](queue.md).

file from another user.

the pane, select which file you'd like to share and click the 'Share'
button. A code will be generated which can be entered in this field.
