## [Temperature](temperature.md)

Temperature Controls for the extruder(s) and heated bed (if present).

## [Movement](movement.md)

Manual movement controls for the nozzle and extruder(s). X, Y, and Z
movement controls switch to fine adjustment during prints.

## [Fan](fan.md)

Manual control of [layer-cooling fan](layer-cooling-fan)
speed.

## [ATX Power Control](atx-power-control)

If the printer's controller board supports it, and if enabled through
[Printer
settings](settings/printer/features/hardware/has-power-control),
this section allows for direct control of the printer's main power.

## [Macros](macros.md)

The Macros section is for saving snippets of G-Code as easy-to-use
buttons. The image on the right has a few examples, blurred as they may
be since those particular buttons are not included with MatterControl by
default.

## [Tuning Adjustment](tuning-adjustment.md)

Allows for manual adjustment of speed and extrusion during a print.

## [Firmware Updater](firmware-updater)

Allows the user to update an Arduino-based printer's firmware from
within MatterControl.
