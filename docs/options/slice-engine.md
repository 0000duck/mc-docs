The **Slice Engine** selection menu.
 MatterControl offers the ability to switch between one of three
slicing engines: [MatterSlice](matterslice.md),
[CuraEngine](curaengine.md), and [Slic3r](slic3r.md).

## Restrictions

  - Third-party slicers (CuraEngine, Slic3r) are not available on all
    versions, including custom-branded OEM builds, and on the
    MatterControl Touch tablets (T7, T10). MatterSlice is the default
    slice engine, and is available in all versions of MatterControl.
  - MatterSlice is the only slice engine available in MatterControl that
    is capable of producing
    [multi-extrusion](multi-extrusion.md) prints. Third-party
    slicers do not appear in the Slice Engine menu when [Extruder
    Count](settings/printer/features/hardware/extruder-count)
    is set to a value greater than 1.
  - Third-party slicers are not available in MatterControl for Linux by
    default, but can be added by following the instructions here:
    [Running on Linux: Using Other Slice
    Engines](development/running-on-linux.md#Using_Other_Slice_Engines)

# [CuraEngine](curaengine.md)
