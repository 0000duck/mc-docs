## [Temperature](controls/temperature)

Temperature Controls for the extruder(s) and heated bed (if present).

## [Movement](controls/movement)

Manual movement controls for the nozzle and extruder(s). X, Y, and Z
movement controls switch to fine adjustment during prints.

## [Fan](controls/fan)

Manual control of [layer-cooling fan](layer-cooling-fan)
speed.

## [ATX Power Control](controls/atx-power-control)

If the printer's controller board supports it, and if enabled through
[Printer
settings](settings/printer/features/hardware/has-power-control),
this section allows for direct control of the printer's main power.

## [Macros](controls/macros)

The Macros section is for saving snippets of G-Code as easy-to-use
buttons. The image on the right has a few examples, blurred as they may
be since those particular buttons are not included with MatterControl by
default.

## [Tuning Adjustment](controls/tuning-adjustment)

Allows for manual adjustment of speed and extrusion during a print.

## [Firmware Updater](controls/firmware-updater)

Allows the user to update an Arduino-based printer's firmware from
