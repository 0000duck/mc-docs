MatterControl Touch is a version of MatterControl software
available only on the [T7](mattercontrol-t7.md) and
[T10](mattercontrol-t10.md) tablets sold by
[MatterHackers](http://www.matterhackers.com). The program functions
mostly the same, but with a few minor UI differences and some additional
features not available in the desktop version of MatterControl.

## Differences

  - [Display Mode](options/display-mode) is **Touchscreen**
    and is not able to be changed; the setting does not appear in the
    OPTIONS menu.
  - The [Sidebar](mattercontrol-touch/sidebar) replaces many
    of the navigation links.
  - [FILE](file-menu.md), [VIEW](view-menu.md), and
    [HELP](help-menu.md) menus have been removed; menu items are
    redistributed elsewhere.
  - The [Gear menu](gear-menu) contains some of the
    redistributed menu items and the sign-in link.
  - [Interface Mode](mattercontrol-touch/interface-mode)
    shows two extra items on the
    [Sidebar](mattercontrol-touch/sidebar).
  - [3D Mode in LAYER VIEW](layer-view.md) is not available.

### Additional Features

  - [Camera
    Monitoring](mattercontrol-touch/camera.md#Monitoring)
  - Option to include a [picture of finished print with
    notification](mattercontrol-touch/camera.md#Notification)
